# Overview

This is an Expo React Native application with Firebase Authentication integration and OpenAI-powered micro-task generation. The app implements email/password authentication with persistent user sessions using AsyncStorage. It features a clean TypeScript architecture with protected routes, form validation, and automatic sign-in/registration flow. The application uses expo-router for navigation, includes an optional onboarding assessment, and has a complete "I feel tempted" procrastination workflow with AI-generated micro-tasks.
